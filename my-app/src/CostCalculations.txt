The following document describes how our team calculated costs for vendors of different levels.
variable names for calculations. Variable names currently do not represent the variable names to be used in the program, but will be updated shortly. 
All variable data is collected from the data provided to us by the YWCA.

TC = total cost
CbS = cost before scholarship
h = total hours spent
oh = overtime hours
m = months
schp = scholarship percentage (represented in decimals 50% = 0.5)
ft = square feet of dry storage
f = freezer units
offseason = 1 or 0 ( true or false value)

Level 1 vendors parameters:
- $20/hour 
- $10/month for dry storage 10 sq. ft.
- $25/month per freezer unit
- scholarship discount (a percent based discount on total cost)

Cost calculation:
CbS = (20 * h) + (10 * m * (ft/10)) + (25 * m * f)
TC = CbS * (1 - schp)






Level 2 vendors parameters:
- $300/month 
- $10/month for dry storage 10 sq. ft.
- $25/month per freezer unit
- $10/hr for overtime (exceeds 30hr a month limit)
- $50/month off season storage
- scholarship discount (a percent based discount on total cost)

Cost calculation:
CbS = (300 * m) + (10 * m * (ft/10)) + (25 * m * f) + (10 * oh) + (50 * offseason)
TC = CbS * (1 - schp)




Level 3 vendors parameters:
- $400/month 
- $10/month for dry storage 10 sq. ft.
- $25/month per freezer unit
- $8/hr for overtime (exceeds 50 hr a month limit)
- $50/month off season storage
- scholarship discount (a percent based discount on total cost)

Cost calculation:
CbS = (400 * m) + (10 * m * (ft/10)) + (25 * m * f) + (8 * oh) + (50 * offseason)
TC = CbS * (1 - schp)
